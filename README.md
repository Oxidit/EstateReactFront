# What's that?

That's a small real estate site template that just shows how it can work on react.

# Installation with terminal

To start with this template you should start 
cmd.exe **:mongod**
cmd.exe (node  or etc) **:**go to the Back directory (https://github.com/Oxidit/EstateReactBack) and start **npm run dev**
cmd.exe **:**go to the Front directory (https://github.com/Oxidit/EstateReactFront) and write **npm start**
 

# Currently supported functionality 
The design sucks a bit for now, I know, it's just a quick sample to show the logic of React. I'm planning to change the template for the best in a while 
:bowtie: 

When the server is open you'll see the following picture:

![Main screen](https://github.com/Oxidit/EstateReactFront/blob/main/Re.png "")
___________________________________________________________
 
You can register (so you could add your apartments)

___________________________________________________________
or log in

 Then you can add your apartment

 Or filter apartments to find the options you want

This template was made rapidly and looks pretty poor, but in case you'd ever like to deploy it I'd really love to help.
Please, feel free to use whatever you like :smile:
